### A Story to Connect the Dots  
Picture this: You're a young chef entering a high-tech kitchen for the first time. The pantry is stocked with amazing ingredients (AI models), but everything has fancy names like "molecular gastronomy" or "umami extract." Without knowing the terms, you'd be lost. Amazon Bedrock is that kitchen, and these key terms are your recipe book – simple words that unlock powerful AI magic. Once you learn them, building AI apps feels like following a favorite recipe!

### Core Building Blocks  
- **Foundation Model (FM):** The "super brain" of AI – a huge model trained on tons of data to handle all sorts of tasks like writing stories, answering questions, or creating images. Think of it as a master chef who can cook anything.[1]
- **Base Model:** A ready-to-use FM from top companies like Amazon or Anthropic – no prep needed, just grab and go for your project.[1]
- **Model Parameters:** The hidden "settings" inside a model that shape how it thinks and responds. Providers tweak these, or you can customize them later.[1]

### How AI Thinks and Responds  
- **Model Inference:** When you give the AI a question (input) and it spits out an answer (output) – like pressing "cook" on your smart oven.[1]
- **Prompt:** Your instruction to the AI, like "Write a poem about cats" or "Summarize this article." Good prompts = great results![1]
- **Token:** Tiny chunks of meaning the AI understands, like words, punctuation, or phrases – billing and limits are often based on tokens.[1]
- **Inference Parameters:** Dials you turn during inference to control creativity, length, or repetition – e.g., make responses shorter or more focused.[1]

### Hands-On Tools and Tricks  
- **Playground:** A fun, clickable sandbox in the AWS console to test prompts, models, and settings without coding – perfect for beginners.[1]
- **Embeddings:** Magic numbers that turn words or images into comparable vectors, so AI can find similarities (e.g., "cat" matches "kitten").[1]

### Advanced Superpowers  
- **Orchestration:** Coordinating AI models with your company's data and apps to complete complex tasks smoothly.[1]
- **Agent:** A smart helper app that uses AI to think step-by-step, call APIs, and get things done – like a virtual assistant on steroids.[1]
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Pull real data from your files, mix it into prompts, and get smarter, fact-checked AI answers.[1]
- **Model Customization:** Train a base model with your data via fine-tuning (with examples) or continued pre-training to make it an expert in your field.[1]
- **Hyperparameters:** Special settings you adjust during customization to fine-tune training results.[1]
- **Model Evaluation:** Test and compare models to pick the winner for your needs.[1]
- **Provisioned Throughput:** Buy extra "horsepower" for faster, cheaper AI processing when your app gets busy.[1]
